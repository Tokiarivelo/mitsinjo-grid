# Maintenance rules (always on): keep Makefile, docs and branches in sync with the code

## Task branching (always first)

- Always create a new branch from latest `main` before beginning any task (`git fetch origin main && git checkout -b feat/<task-id>-<slug> origin/main`). Never start work directly on `main` or an un-rebased stale branch.

## Makefile

- When you add or use a command someone will run again (script, test filter, generator, tool, deploy step),
  add a Makefile target in the matching `##@` section with a `## short description`. Check `make help` shows it.
- When a `package.json` script is added, renamed or removed, update the target that wraps it in the same commit.
- Targets that need the workspace start with `$(need_ws)`. Keep recipes short; put long logic in `scripts/*.sh`.
- Don't add one-off or destructive targets without a clear name (`clean-*`, `deploy`).

## .env.example (always in sync)

- `.env.example` lists **every** env var the project reads: app (`src/lib/env.ts`), tooling and MCP
  (`.mcp.json`), scripts, CI, deploy. Add, rename or remove a var → update `.env.example` in the same commit.
- Group by section with a one-line comment: what reads it, where to get the value, and allowed values.
- Placeholders or safe defaults only (`LLM_PROVIDER=mock`), never real values. Secrets go in `.env` / `.env.local` (gitignored).
- Also update what loads env (`scripts/env.sh`, Makefile `env` / `claude` / `env-export`) and the README run
  section when the setup steps change.

## Neon database (always migrate)

- A change to anything stored in Neon (a new table or column, a new persisted field of a stored type such as
  `ChatMessageData`, a new JSONB block) **appends a migration** to `apps/web/src/server/db/migrations.ts`
  in the same commit: next `NNNN_snake_case` id, idempotent SQL (`IF NOT EXISTS`). Never edit, rename or
  reorder a migration that has shipped; fix forward with a new one.
- Migrations apply **automatically**: on the app's first database call, and with `make db-migrate`. After adding
  one, run `make db-migrate` (applies to the Neon DB in `.env`) and report the result.
- Engine-only Zod schemas (not stored) need no migration; say so when unsure.

## Documentation (same commit as the code, update only what changed, keep it terse)

- Docs describe what the code does now: no plans written as facts, no copied code blocks longer than a type signature.
- If code and doc disagree and you can't tell which is right, ask; don't silently "fix" either.
