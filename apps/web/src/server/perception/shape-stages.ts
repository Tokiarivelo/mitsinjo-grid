/**
 * Staged agent loop (PG-T16): the model is improved one stage at a time (massing → roof →
 * openings → accessories). Per stage, up to `maxRounds` rounds: the proposer (Spark, PG-T15)
 * answers patch ops for the stage's components only, the engine compiles them op by op with
 * smaller steps (`microPatch`), and the ops that raise the stage score without lowering the
 * overall score are kept. A stage stops at its gate, after `STAGE_MAX_MISSES` rounds without
 * gain (the retry is told what each op did), at `maxRounds`, when a further round would leave no
 * time for one round of each later stage (`rounds`: breadth first, the final check always gets
 * its turn), or when the shared time budget runs out (the rest keeps the seed). Deterministic given the same proposer answers. Pure apart from the
 * injected proposer and clock.
